# Checking-date-validity-using-MATLAB
The file is of MATLAB type. For some reason it is showing C. But the type is .m type.
The program checks a given date in the format YYYY/MM/DD and prints whether it is valid or not.
All the conditions including float type dates, inputs not equal 3 return False.
Any error or major changes that might enhance the size of the program is welcomed.
